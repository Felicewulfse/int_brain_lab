## Thesis project Felice Wulfse, March 2023

For my thesis I studied the differences in learning speed between mice and across laboratories in the decision-making task of the International Brain Laboratory et al. (2021). More specifically, I investigated the role of the light cycle used during the experiments and training time consistency of the mice on learning speed. My supervisor dr. A.E. Urai has guided me through the project.

# Explaining differences in learning speed in the decision-making task of the International Brain laboratory by light cycle and training time consistency

The script _Analysis_script_ is used to analyse the data. The script is divided in three parts:
1. Step 1: SET UP AND LOAD DATA
2. Step 2: CREATE VARIABLES NEEDED FOR THE ANALYSES
3. Step 3: REATE EXPLORATIVE PLOTS 
4. Step 4: STEP 4: ANALYSIS


Step 1: In the first step, I load required packages and I set my environment. Moreover, I read in the data, which I downloaded via https://anne-urai.github.io/lab_wiki/IBLdata_behav.html. 


Step 2: In the second step, I
