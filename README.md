## Thesis project Felice Wulfse, March 2023

For my thesis I studied the differences in learning speed across laboratories and between individual mice in the decision-making task of the International Brain Laboratory et al. (2021). More specifically, I investigated the role of the light cycle used during the experiments and training time consistency of the mice on learning speed. My supervisor dr. A.E. Urai has guided me through the project.

# Explaining differences in learning speed in the decision-making task of the International Brain laboratory by light cycle and training time consistency

The script _Analysis_script_ is used to analyse the data. The script is divided in three parts:
1. Step 1: Set up 
2. Step 2: Data manipulation
3. Step 3: Data visualisation
4. Step 4: Analyses


Step 1: In the first step, I load required packages and I set my environment. Moreover, I read in the data, which I downloaded via https://anne-urai.github.io/lab_wiki/IBLdata_behav.html. After downloading the data, I saved the data frames in excel files, so that I did not have to make a connection to the database each time I would work on the project. My script to download the data can be found in xxx. 

Step 2: In the second step, I manipulated the data and created variables used for the analyses. 

Step 3: As thrird, I created the plots used to explain the data.

Step 4: At last, I performed data analysis using Kruskall-Wallis tests, t-tests and mixture analyses.
