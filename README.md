# Explaining differences in learning speed in the decision-making task of the International Brain laboratory by light cycle and training time consistency

For my thesis I studied the differences in learning speed and the influence of the light cycle and training time consistency, in the decision-making task of the International Brain Laboratory. 

The script _Analysis_script_ is used to analyse the data. The script is divided in three parts:
1. Step 1: SET UP AND LOAD DATA
2. Step 2: CREATE VARIABLES NEEDED FOR THE ANALYSES
3. Step 3: REATE EXPLORATIVE PLOTS 
4. Step 4: STEP 4: ANALYSIS
